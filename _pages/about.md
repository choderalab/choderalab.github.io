The Chodera lab uses computation and experiments to develop quantitative, multiscale models of the 
effects of small molecules on biomolecular macromolecules and cellular pathways. To do this, the 
group utilizes physical models and rigorous statistical mechanics, with the overall goals of 
engineering novel therapeutics and tools for chemical biology, as well as understanding the 
physical driving forces behind ligand recognition the evolution of resistance mutations.

The Chodera group makes use of advanced algorithms for molecular dynamics simulations on graphics
processing units (GPUs) and distributed computing platforms, in addition to robot-driven moderate 
and high-throughput experiments focusing on characterizing biophysical interactions between 
proteins and small molecules.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
