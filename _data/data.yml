  - name: "Solvated alanine dipeptide - thermodynamics and kinetics"
    authors: "Daniel L. Parton, Patrick B. Grinaway, Sonya M. Hanson, Kyle A. Beauchamp, and John D. Chodera"
    description: "A collection of datasets of the alanine dipeptide (more specifically, terminally-blocked alanine peptide) in explicit solvent. These datasets cover both thermodynamic simulations (parallel tempering) and kinetic simulations (Hamiltonian dynamics trajectories) useful for testing algorithms analyzing the thermodynamics and kinetics of biomolecular systems. This model system has already been used in several research papers."
