  - name: Universal Portrait/Landscape Tecan EVO One-Place MTP Carrier
    description: Single position plate carrier designed such that the center of the plate is at the same position in space with respect to the deck whether the carrier is positioned in a portrait or landscape orientation.  The robotic manipulator arm (RoMa) can therefore access plates on this carrier in either orientation after being trained once.
    compatibility: Designed with slots for pins corresponding to Tecan Freedom EVO deck.
    authors: Designed collaboratively by John Chodera, MSKCC; Nikki Aldeborgh, research technician in the Kayvan Keshari lab, MSKCC; Sonya Hanson, postdoctoral research fellow in Chodera Lab, MSKCC; and Julie Behr, CBM graduate student, during rotation in Chodera lab, MSKCC.
