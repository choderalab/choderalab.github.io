Chodera lab Postdoctoral Fellow Maria A. Castellanos was awarded a poster prize at the [Computational Medicinal Chemistry School](https://compmedchem.org/) held Oct 28-30, 2024 at the Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, MA.

Working with [ASAP Antiviral Discovery Consortium](http://asapdiscovery.org/) computational chemistry lead Jenke Scheen and senior graduate student Alexander Payne, Maria has developed a pipeline aimed at predicting the breadth of antiviral activity for direct-acting small molecule antivirals, with the goal of prioritizing molecules for synthesis that maximize breadth of activity within a viral family. 
This pipeline leverages AlphaFold-like methods and high-throughput crystallographic data generated by the [Diamond Light Source](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Mx/Fragment-Screening.html) along with machine-learned affinity prediction to predict and score potential binding modes to the viral target across the viral family. The resulting pipeline will aid the $68M NIH-funded ASAP Consortium in developing broad-spectrum direct-acting antivirals to prevent future pandemics.
