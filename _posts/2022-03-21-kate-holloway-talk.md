I’m thrilled to have the opportunity to speak at the [ACS Award for Computers in Chemical & Pharmaceutical Research in honor of Kate Holloway](https://acs.digitellinc.com/acs/live/22/page/677/1?eventSearchDateTimeEnd=&eventSearchDateTimeStart=&eventSearchInput=kate%20holloway), whose incredible career in drug discovery to date involves contributions to the invention of over sixty ligands for different therapeutic targets, including successful HIV inhibitors that have significantly changed patient outcomes for those living with AIDS. Kate’s tireless work to improve the field and visionary view on what computational chemistry is capable of are an inspiration to us all.
