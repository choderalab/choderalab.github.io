I had the great pleasure of speaking to the NIH Biomedical Information Science and Technology Initiative (**BISTI**) community on 3 Feb 2022 about open science antiviral drug discovery with the [COVID Moonshot ](http://postera.ai/covid)and how the open source computer-aided drug discovery ecosystem functions as a fantastic mechanism to enable collaboration to address major challenges in drug discovery. Open source software communities such as the [Open Molecular Software Foundation (OMSF)](http://omsf.io), which sponsors the [Open Force Field Initiative](http://openforcefield.org) and the Open Free Energy Consortium, and [OpenMM](http://openmm.org), play a major role in this. Community-wide blind challenges, such as [D3R](https://drugdesigndata.org), [SAMPL](https://www.samplchallenges.org), and the new [CACHE](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41570-022-00363-z) effort (a CASP for computational hit-finding), are also collaborative open science engines that drive progress.
