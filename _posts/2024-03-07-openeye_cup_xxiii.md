I had the privilege of being called on to give the final talk of this year’s [OpenEye CUP XXIII](https://www.eyesopen.com/events/cup-2024) to close an engaging meeting full of excitement for structure-based drug discovery. 
In this talk, I highlight the rapid work going on in machine learned (ML) potentials and their growing role in alchemical free energy calculations for structure-enabled drug discovery, and close with a provocative opportunity for the future of computer-aided drug discovery.
