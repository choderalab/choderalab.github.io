I was honored to speak at the NCATS Assay Guidance Manual in silico drug discovery workshop, hosted virtually 23-24 Oct 2024. 
I presented an overview of modern physics-based free energy calculations for drug discovery, highlighting the open source ecosystem from [Open Free Energy](http://openfree.energy/), [Open Force Field](http://openforcefield.org/), and other [Open Molecular Software Foundation (OMSF)](http://omsf.io/) projects.
